    <!-- Slide 1 – Title -->
    <section>
      <h1>SkyGeni Sales Intelligence – Win‑Rate Deep Dive (Part 2)</h1>
      <h3>Win‑rate breakdown, business insights, and custom metrics</h3>
      <p class="note">Data source: SkyGeni sales dataset (2023–2024). [file:1]</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 2 – Executive summary -->
    <section>
      <h2>Executive summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>FinTech has the highest win rate at ~48%, while EdTech is lower at ~44%, showing stronger positioning in financial services than in education. [file:1]</li>
        <li>Across regions, win rates are tightly clustered around 45–46%, with India and Europe slightly ahead and no geography dramatically underperforming. [file:1]</li>
        <li>Additional EDA highlights three main levers: high‑intent leads, mid‑sized deals, and reduced late‑stage leakage. [file:1]</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 3 – Win rate by industry -->
    <section>
      <h2>Win rate by industry</h2>
      <p>Win rate varies more by industry than by region, with FinTech leading and EdTech lagging. [file:1]</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Industry</th>
            <th>Win rate (≈)</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>FinTech</td><td>48% [file:1]</td></tr>
          <tr><td>SaaS</td><td>46% [file:1]</td></tr>
          <tr><td>HealthTech</td><td>45% [file:1]</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Ecommerce</td><td>45% [file:1]</td></tr>
          <tr><td>EdTech</td><td>44% [file:1]</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <ul>
        <li>Best‑performing industry: FinTech (~48% win rate). [file:1]</li>
        <li>Lowest‑performing industry: EdTech (~44% win rate). [file:1]</li>
        <li>Focus: strengthen the EdTech playbook (positioning, pricing, messaging). [file:1]</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 4 – Win rate by region -->
    <section>
      <h2>Win rate by region</h2>
      <p>Regional performance is tightly clustered; no region is a clear outlier. [file:1]</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Region</th>
            <th>Win rate (≈)</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>India</td><td>46% [file:1]</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Europe</td><td>46% [file:1]</td></tr>
          <tr><td>North America</td><td>45% [file:1]</td></tr>
          <tr><td>APAC</td><td>45% [file:1]</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <ul>
        <li>India and Europe are slightly ahead, but only by ~1 percentage point. [file:1]</li>
        <li>All regions sit around 45–46%, so geography is not the main driver of win‑rate variance. [file:1]</li>
        <li>Priority: industry‑specific and motion‑specific fixes rather than regional reshuffles. [file:1]</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 5 – Insight 1: Lead source quality -->
    <section>
      <h2>Insight 1 – Lead source quality</h2>
      <div class="two-column">
        <div>
          <h3>What we see</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Inbound and referral leads show significantly higher win rates than outbound or cold partner‑sourced leads. [file:1]</li>
            <li>High‑intent demand yields materially more wins per opportunity than low‑intent outbound. [file:1]</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What to do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Re‑weight SDR time and marketing spend toward inbound‑like channels (content, events, advocacy, partner enablement). [file:1]</li>
            <li>Tighten qualification and disqualification rules for low‑intent outbound leads. [file:1]</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 6 – Insight 2: Deal size sweet spot -->
    <section>
      <h2>Insight 2 – Deal size sweet spot</h2>
      <p>Bucketing deals by ACV (Small, Mid, Upper‑Mid, Enterprise) shows win rates typically peak in the mid/upper‑mid bands. [file:1]</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Very small deals often churn with “no decision” due to low perceived value. [file:1]</li>
        <li>Very large enterprise deals stall or are lost late because of complexity and multi‑stakeholder risk. [file:1]</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Actions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a fast‑track motion for small deals: simplified pricing, minimal approvals, shorter process. [file:1]</li>
        <li>Build an “enterprise pursuit” motion for large deals: executive sponsor, multi‑threading, ROI/value selling, stronger stage exit criteria. [file:1]</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 7 – Insight 3: Late-stage leakage -->
    <section>
      <h2>Insight 3 – Late‑stage leakage</h2>
      <p>A disproportionate share of lost deals are lost in late stages (Proposal, Negotiation, final Closed‑Lost), not just at early qualification. [file:1]</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This suggests issues in pricing, competitive positioning, and stakeholder alignment rather than pure top‑of‑funnel volume. [file:1]</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Actions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Standardize late‑stage battlecards (competitors, pricing objections, ROI proof, references, procurement/legal playbook). [file:1]</li>
        <li>Require structured reviews for high‑value deals before proposals go out (champion check, economic buyer, quantified value case). [file:1]</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 8 – Custom metric: PQI -->
    <section>
      <h2>Custom metric – Pipeline Quality Index (PQI)</h2>
      <div class="two-column">
        <div>
          <h3>Definition</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>For each segment (industry, region, or rep), compute: win rate, median/mean deal amount (ACV), and share of high‑intent leads (Inbound + Referral). [file:1]</li>
            <li>Normalize each component to 0–1 across segments. [file:1]</li>
            <li>PQI(segment) = average of the three normalized values. [file:1]</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How to use</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>High PQI: strong win rate, healthy deal sizes, and high‑intent pipeline (e.g., FinTech). [file:1]</li>
            <li>Low PQI: weaker win rate and/or small, low‑intent deals (e.g., EdTech). [file:1]</li>
            <li>CRO uses PQI to prioritize where to invest versus where to fix ICP, pricing, or messaging first. [file:1]</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 9 – Custom metric: LSDR -->
    <section>
      <h2>Custom metric – Late‑Stage Drop‑off Rate (LSDR)</h2>
      <div class="two-column">
        <div>
          <h3>Definition</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Define “late stages” as all stages at/after Proposal/Negotiation. [file:1]</li>
            <li>For a segment: Numerator = deals that reached a late stage and ended Lost; Denominator = all deals that reached a late stage. [file:1]</li>
            <li>LSDR = Numerator ÷ Denominator. [file:1]</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How to use</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>High LSDR pinpoints segments where pricing, competition, or stakeholder alignment is failing at the end of the cycle. [file:1]</li>
            <li>Track LSDR by industry and lead source; target enablement and process changes where LSDR is worst. [file:1]</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 10 – Actions for the CRO -->
    <section>
      <h2>Recommended actions for the CRO</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Double‑down on high‑intent lead sources (Inbound/Referral) and re‑qualify low‑intent outbound segments. [file:1]</li>
        <li>Protect and scale the mid/upper‑mid ACV “sweet spot” while tailoring motions for very small and very large enterprise deals. [file:1]</li>
        <li>Use PQI to prioritize investment and LSDR to monitor and fix late‑stage leakage, especially in underperforming industries like EdTech. [file:1]</li>
      </ul>
